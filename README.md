# Bash Commands:

## 1- LS:

List directory contents,is probably the most common command. A lot of times, you’ll be working in a directory and you’ll need to know what files are located there. The ls command allows you to quickly view all files within the specified directory.

## 2- echo:

Prints text to the terminal window and is typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file. Echo is also particularly useful for showing the values of environmental variables, which tell the shell how to behave as a user works at the command line or in scripts.

## 3- touch:

Is going to be the easiest way to create new files, but it can also be used to change timestamps on files and/or directories. You can create as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name.

## 4- mkdir:

Is a useful command you can use to create directories. Any number of directories can be created simultaneously which can greatly speed up the process.
